<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a self-driven, results oriented technology professional with over 10 years in the public and private sector. 
  I have experience in data and system analysis, database management, open source intelligence gathering, project management, and Microsoft Windows SharePoint. 
  I took some time off to raise my son and I am now looking to resume my career. Last couple of years, through self-study and determination I became certified as an AWS Solutions Architect - Associate. 
  In addition to my interests in the Cloud Technologies, Iâ€™m also interested in expanding my skillsets in Web Development and Data Analysis from my previous experience. 
  I'm currently taking online courses in Web Development Bootcamp, Machine Learning & Data Science along with Python, SQL, and Tableau. </p>
